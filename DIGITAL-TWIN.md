# Digital Twin at MFI

Welcome to the Digital Twin page of the Manufacturing Futures Institute (MFI) Codebase. Here you will find a collection of projects, code, and packages specifically related to our work in Digital Twin.

## Testbed Project

The objective of the project is to emulate high-mix/low-volume continuous manufacturing. The envisioned testbed is a circular manufacturing ecosystem where parts are assembled, then disassembled such that no material is wasted and where 24/7 operational costs are low, providing potential to generate large datasets. An initial target application is the assembly and disassembly of LEGOÂ® blocks as a fun and compelling technology demonstrator and driver. The expected testbed will grow and build upon a reusable and open-sourced codebase.

Below are various subsystems of the testbed and associated repos.

1. **Yaskawa GP4 Robots**:
    - [motoman_ros1](https://github.com/cmu-mfi/motoman_ros1) : ROS1 implementation of robot controller interface. Includes GP4 assets, MoveIt configuration, and service implementation. 
    - [gp4-lego-assembly](https://github.com/cmu-mfi/gp4-lego-assembly) : Lego assembly package for GP4

2. **Programmable Light Curtains for Safety**:
    - [bluelc-rpi](https://github.com/cmu-mfi/bluelc-rpi): Onboard compute utilities (like: curtain profile generation) for the blue device.
    - [redlc-rpi](https://github.com/cmu-mfi/redlc-rpi): Onboard compute utilities for the red device.
    - [lc-utils](https://github.com/cmu-mfi/lc-utils): Visualization and calibration utilities for the tesbed
    - [LC-CORE](https://github.com/cmu-mfi/LC-CORE): Driver code for light curtain devices [limited access]
