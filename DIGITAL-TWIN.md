# Digital Twin at MFI

Welcome to the Digital Twin page of the Manufacturing Futures Institute (MFI) Codebase. Here you will find a collection of projects, code, and packages specifically related to our work in Digital Twin.

## Testbed Project

The objective of the project is to emulate high-mix/low-volume continuous manufacturing. The envisioned testbed is a circular manufacturing ecosystem where parts are assembled, then disassembled such that no material is wasted and where 24/7 operational costs are low, providing potential to generate large datasets. An initial target application is the assembly and disassembly of LEGOÂ® blocks as a fun and compelling technology demonstrator and driver. The expected testbed will grow and build upon a reusable and open-sourced codebase.

Below are various subsystems of the testbed and associated repos.

1. **Yaskawa GP4 Robots**:

4. **Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR)**: [Link to Repo 1] [Link to Repo 2]
5. **MES and Scheduling**: [Link to Repo 1] [Link to Repo 2]
